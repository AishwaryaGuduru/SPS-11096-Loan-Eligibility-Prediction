Project Description:

Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties.

Solution:

The main aim of this use-case is to build a predictive model to predict if an applicant is able to repay the lending company or not.
